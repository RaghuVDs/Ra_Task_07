# Syracuse Men’s Lacrosse – Strategic Recommendations (Post-2024 Audit)

## Overview
This report summarizes the post-2024 season audit and strategic roadmap for Syracuse Men’s Lacrosse. With a **12–6 record** and a **+67 goal differential**, the team’s offensive output is strong. The key risk factor for 2025 is **possession control**, where small margins cost critical games.  

## Purpose
The report identifies and prioritizes **high-leverage actions** that can elevate Syracuse from strong contender to championship caliber. The guiding principle: *Maximum Impact, Minimum Drama.*  

## Key Recommendations

### Operational (Low Risk – Immediate)
- Integrate **zero-tolerance clearing drills** in all practices (target 0.900 efficiency).
- Standardize defensive communication for ride/clear plays to reduce turnovers.

### Investigatory (Medium Risk – Resource Allocation)
- Invest in **Mason Kohn as a possession specialist** with dedicated technical training, camera analysis, and biomechanics coaching.  
- Analyze clearing schemes of 2024 top-performing opponents and replicate effective strategies.

### High-Stakes (High Risk – Personnel & Strategy)
- By end of Fall, conduct a **faceoff performance audit**.  
- If targets are unmet, plan 2026 recruitment for an elite FO specialist.

## Ethical Considerations
- Focus on one athlete (Kohn) must be framed as **investment and support**, not pressure.  
- Provide private benchmarks and sports psychology resources to safeguard morale.  

## Next Steps
1. Begin operational tasks (clearing drills, communication standards) immediately.  
2. Launch possession specialist program during Fall.  
3. Validate progress by **November** using Athletics Analytics metrics.  
4. Review outcomes quarterly via formal audit process.
